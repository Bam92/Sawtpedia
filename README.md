# Sawtpedia
This is a joint development project of [Wikimedia Tunisia](https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Wikimedia_Tunisie) and [Data Engineering and Semantics Research Unit](http://www.fss.rnu.tn/eng/s3465/pages/819/DES-UNIT) within the framework of [Hack4OpenGLAM](https://hack4openglam.okf.fi/). Based on an inspiration from the logic of [QRpedia](https://qrpedia.org), Yamen Bousrih has first presented the [idea](https://hack4openglam.okf.fi/tools/audioqrpedia/) at the Hack4OpenGLAM Showcase at the 2021 Creative Commons Global Summit. Then, he has disseminated it in Wikimedia Conferences such as [WikidataCon 2021](https://pretalx.com/wdcon21/talk/BPE3VZ/). Deployed at https://sawtpedia.toolforge.org, it generates a QRCode related to a monument that once scanned with fetch the wikidata page for that monument and open the audio file in the mobile phone's language using the statement spoken text audio and the property P407.



Following the same logic as QRPedia codes (qrpedia.org), Sawtpedia .
